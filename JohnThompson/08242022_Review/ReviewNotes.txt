Review Notes

Date: 8/24/2022
Code: findspike.m
Review partner: Marielle
Notes: 
1. input arguments unclear - discussed adding one specific to directory and date of file
2. unclear use of spike time extraction code - was using FileExchange I didn't fully understand input/output - will try using findpeaks (in matlab) and thresholds to verify 
3. suggested interim visualization to clarify the relationship between time points and cluster identity

Planned updates:
